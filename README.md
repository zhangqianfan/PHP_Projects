## Some explanations about "train":
1. This is an online & offline train schedule query program, and the offline query module is not the focus of this project. The real core points of this project are in the online query module which is stored in the directory "train/online".
2. The approach to enter the online query module is to put all files and folders in "train" on a server and open "http://127.0.0.1/train/online/query-by-sta-to-sta.htm" in a browser.
3. The online query module of this project may fail to request the required information in sometimes account for the possible limitation of cross-domain access in 12306.cn.
